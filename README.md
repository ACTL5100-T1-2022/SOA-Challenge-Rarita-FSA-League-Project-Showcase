# Executive Summary

This report focuses on the creation of a competitive national football team for Rarita. The decision to create a national team might, at first, seem to be a sound one. In the UK for instance, the value added to the economy by the Premier League grossed 7.6 billion pounds in 2019/20 (EY, 2022). However, the implementation will not be an easy one. Indeed, to generate a positive cash flow for the country, we must take into consideration the allocated budget to fund the team, while making sure that the brand created around the latter generates a positive income stream.  

Throughout this report, we will undertake a team selection analysis by creating a player performance index and taking into consideration relevant performance metrics as well as the player’s salary. These metrics include, but are not limited to, the number of goals per shot, the number shots per match, the average distance from the goal of all shots taken and even the number of tackles and interceptions. Further, in an attempt to create a benchmark for our team selection, we used six of the countries that ranked in the top 10 in both 2020 and 2021 and found the distribution to be approximately normal.
We will then outline a plausible implementation plan as well as detail the economic impact of the team on Rarita’s GDP. To increase the team’s value, we hope to create a brand around them which would positively impact the country’s economy. 

We will then finish our analysis by underlining key risks and limitations that would prevent Rarita from reaching its goal and how to potentially mitigate them. These risks include the health condition of the players at the time of the competition, inherent risks associated with simulations and other unforeseen circumstances associated with huge economic impacts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Objectives

* Player Performance Index (PPI): measure the ability of player
* Salary Efficiency (SE): measuring whether a player is worth the salary he receives
